# README #

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repo contains a quick C++ exercise. For the full description please check `Airport Simulation.pdf`  

### How do I get set up? ###

* Check `main.cpp` for a simple runner.
* Check `CMakeLists.txt` for a skeleton of the cmakelist file. If you keep the implementation inside main.cpp file, all you need to build & run the project is execute these commands (example for *nix systems) in the project folder:

```
$ cmake . && make
$ ./AirportSimulator
```

* For more information on how to install CMake and configure it on your platform of choice, see [https://cmake.org/install/](https://cmake.org/install/)
* If you add any more `*.cpp` files to the project, they need to be added to the CMakeLists.txt, see above for more info.
